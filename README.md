# How this works

The following files are used to scrape ESPN Fantasy Football league data:

1. matchups_table.py
2. players_table.py
3. slots_table.py
4. teams_table.py

These files can be executed in any order, and each will write data to a user-specified database. Instructions for running these files are described below.
